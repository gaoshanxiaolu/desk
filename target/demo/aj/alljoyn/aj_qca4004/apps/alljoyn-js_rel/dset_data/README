This directory may be populated with files, which will be marshalled into a
set of Ruby DSETs and combined with an executable as part of the final
flashable/execuatable image.  The data contained within the files is immaterial
to the build process, but should conform to whatever format the runtime
code needs to operate correctly. Files may be binary or ascii.

Naming Convention examples:

XXXXXXXX.js.nvm         -- Include file (One only) as an executable alljoyn-js script

YYYYYYYY_ro_1bf4.nvm    -- Include file as a Read-Only AJ_NVRAM item with id of 0x1bf4

ZZZZZZZZ_rw_01b4.nvm    -- Include file as the Factory Reset value of a Read-Writeable
                           AJ_NVRAM item with id of 0x01b4

The leading part of the file is free-form and can be named anything of any length. The
ro vs rw part of the file name is mandatory, to indicate it is part of the Read Onky DSET
or the Factory Reset DSET.  The 4-digit hex value is mandatory, must be four digits long,
and should be unique amoung all other files in this directory.

Files that do not follow this naming convention (such as this README file) are ignored.
