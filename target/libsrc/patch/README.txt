NOTE:
Customer intending to patch QCOM source in target must build the patch library(libcustpatches.a) explicitly by calling "make".
Make would export the library to /lib in the SDK.
Application needs to link against the libcustpatches.a library to compile.
Please note that any customer patch/patches will override all previous QCOM supplied patches in case of conflicts.
