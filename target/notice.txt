// This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
// The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
// written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
// This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
//
// Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
// This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
// except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
// with every copy.
//
// To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
// MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
// needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
// will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

This header contains definitions and macros for use primarily by Xtensa
RTOS assembly coded source files. It includes and uses the Xtensa hardware
abstraction layer (HAL) to deal with config specifics. It may also be

Licensing
---------

SRP is royalty-free worldwide for commercial and non-commercial use.
The SRP library has been carefully written not to depend on any
encumbered algorithms, and it is distributed under a standard
BSD-style Open Source license which is shown below.  This license
covers implementations based on the SRP library as well as
independent implementations based on RFC 2945.

The SRP distribution itself contains algorithms and code from
various freeware packages; these parts fall under both the SRP
Open Source license and the packages' own licenses.  Care has
been taken to ensure that these licenses are compatible with
Open Source distribution, but it is the responsibility of the
licensee to comply with the terms of these licenses.  This
disclaimer also applies to third-party libraries that may be
linked into the distribution, since they may contain patented
intellectual property.  The file "Copyrights" contains a list
of the copyrights incorporated by portions of the software.

Broader use of the SRP authentication technology, such as variants
incorporating the use of an explicit server secret (SRP-Z), may
require a license; please contact the Stanford Office of Technology
Licensing (http://otl.stanford.edu/) for more information about
terms and conditions.

This software is covered under the following copyright:

/*

 * permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to
 * the following conditions:

 * THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE, AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT
 * OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
 *
 * In addition, the following conditions apply:
 *
 * 1. Any software that incorporates the SRP authentication technology
 *    is requested to display the following acknowlegment:
 *    "This product uses the 'Secure Remote Password' cryptographic
 *     authentication system developed by Tom Wu (tjw@CS.Stanford.EDU)."
 *
 * 2. Any software that incorporates all or part of the SRP distribution
 *    itself must display the following acknowledgment:
 *    "This product includes software developed by Tom Wu and Eugene
 *     Jhong for the SRP Distribution (http://srp.stanford.edu/)."
 *
 * 3. Redistributions in source or binary form must retain an intact copy
 *    of this copyright notice and list of conditions.
